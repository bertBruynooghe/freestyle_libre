The idea of this project is to be able to read relevant data from the Abbott FreeStyle Libre through USB.


In first instance, this will stay nothing more than a simple ruby snippet which outputs some of the data.

As for now, I will limit myself to macOS, although it should work as-is on Windows and Linux too.

Planned spin-offs of thus project are:

* a tool that directly uploads meter values to NightScout
* a 'library' for arduino to get access to the meter values.
